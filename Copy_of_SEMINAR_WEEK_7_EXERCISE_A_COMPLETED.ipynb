        "\n",
        "3.  **`employment_type`**: This is a nominal variable, meaning there is no inherent order between its categories. For such variables, one-hot encoding is appropriate. This will create new binary columns for each unique employment type, preventing the model from inferring a false sense of order or scale. We will drop the first dummy variable to avoid multicollinearity."
